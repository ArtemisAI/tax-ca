# Test Plan Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the tax-ca library, providing validation for Canadian tax calculations across different scenarios and ensuring system reliability and performance.

## Testing Framework Structure

### Core Testing Directories

```
tests/
├── scenarios/          # Real-world tax scenario tests
├── integration/        # Cross-module integration tests  
├── performance/        # Performance and stress tests
├── jest.config.js      # Jest configuration
└── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript config for tests
```

### Existing Tests (Source Directory)
The original test suite is maintained in the `src/` directory structure:
```
src/
├── utils/tests/        # Utility function tests
├── taxes/tests/        # Tax calculation tests
├── pension/tests/      # Pension calculation tests
└── investments/tests/  # Investment account tests
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Scenario Tests (`tests/scenarios/`)

**Purpose**: Validate tax calculations against real-world Canadian taxpayer scenarios

**Test Files:**
- `young-professional.spec.ts` - Entry-level professionals in ON and QC
- `family.spec.ts` - Families with children, single parents
- `retiree.spec.ts` - Retirement scenarios with pension income

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Income tax calculations for different provinces
- ✅ Federal and provincial tax interactions
- ✅ Tax credits and deductions
- ✅ Pension contribution scenarios
- ✅ OAS clawback calculations

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)

**Purpose**: Ensure different tax-ca modules work together correctly

**Test Files:**
- `complete-tax-calculation.spec.ts` - End-to-end tax calculations

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Federal and provincial tax coordination
- ✅ CPP contribution calculations
- ✅ RRSP and TFSA limit validations
- ✅ Cross-provincial tax comparisons

### 3. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/`)

**Purpose**: Validate calculation performance and memory efficiency

**Test Files:**
- `tax-calculations.spec.ts` - Performance benchmarks

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Single calculation speed (< 10ms target)
- ✅ Bulk processing (1000 calculations < 1s)
- ✅ Memory leak detection
- ✅ Varied income level performance

## Test Scenarios

### Individual Taxpayer Scenarios

#### Young Professional - Ontario
- **Profile**: Age 25, $55k income, single
- **Key Tests**: Basic federal/provincial tax, RRSP contributions
- **Expected Range**: 15-25% effective tax rate

#### Young Professional - Quebec  
- **Profile**: Age 27, $50k income, single
- **Key Tests**: Federal abatement, higher provincial rates
- **Expected**: Higher provincial tax than Ontario

#### Retiree - Ontario
- **Profile**: Age 68, $84.5k total income (pension + RRIF + OAS/CPP)
- **Key Tests**: Pension credits, age credits, no CPP contributions
- **Expected**: Benefits from senior tax credits

#### High-Income Retiree - BC
- **Profile**: Age 70, $115k income, OAS clawback
- **Key Tests**: OAS clawback calculations, higher tax brackets
- **Expected**: Some OAS clawback, higher effective rate

### Family Scenarios

#### Young Family - Ontario
- **Profile**: Couple, 2 children, $75k + $45k incomes
- **Key Tests**: Family tax planning, CPP contributions
- **Expected**: Benefits from progressive brackets and credits

#### Single Parent - BC
- **Profile**: Single parent, 1 child, $62k income
- **Key Tests**: Enhanced credits, childcare deductions
- **Expected**: Significant single parent benefits

## Performance Targets

### Calculation Speed
- **Single Tax Calculation**: < 10ms
- **1000 Bulk Calculations**: < 1 second
- **Complex Scenarios**: < 5ms for data access

### Memory Usage
- **Typical Scenarios**: < 100MB
- **Extended Use**: No memory leaks
- **10,000 Calculations**: < 50MB increase

## Validation Accuracy

### Target Accuracy
- **95%+ accuracy** compared to CRA calculators
- **All calculations** validated for current tax year
- **Cross-provincial** consistency maintained

### Test Data Sources
- Official CRA tax calculators
- Provincial tax authority data
- Current year tax brackets and rates
- Published pension and benefit amounts
